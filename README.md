# How to build?
You will need Visual Studio 2012 or later with Visual Studio SDK installed.
The marketplace version is built with Visual Studio 2012 for compatibility reasons. Using the Microsoft.Net.Compilers NuGet package new C# features are still usable. For development any version from 2012 will do, however VSIX packages built by later versions usually do not work with earlier versions of Visual Studio.
